# NotSoSilly


Enable physics for gears placed so you can place your stuff around naturally, or pile up canned foods.

The initial goal is a SillyMod alternative that is practical to use in survival.

### While not so silly, just like SillyMod, physics enabled gears may disappear **if you don't utilize the **Retrieve** feature**, use at your own risk.

## Usage

First, enable the mod by pressing the Toggle Key (default is O), this is intended so players must intentionally use the mod.

Just like in Vanilla, right click to move gears, when it's placed, physics is enabled for 10 seconds.

If the item is too far away (10m) when the time's up, it will be teleported back to you. So no cheating and when things fall into the ground (yes, that could happen when physics enabled in this game) it may come back automatically (not 100%).

You can also press the Retrieve Key (default: Backspace) to teleport items back to you. (Only possible in the 10 seconds)


## Notes

- It's a good idea to **immediately** press Retrieve when you see your gear falls into walls and grounds. The automatic retrieving won't work when the gear falls and stays on something inside the walls/grounds. You could lose the gear for good.

- It's a good idea to **immediately** press Retrieve when you when the gear rolls to somewhere out of reach, like somewhere blocked by unbreakble objects. You could lose the gear for good.

- Some gears just won't work because how it's structured, like bedrolls, they have 2 modes: dropped/placed. These kinds of gears are hard to handle, so they are skipped.

- The mod temporarily enables collision between gears for about 10 seconds after you placed down one, so gears you placed will actually collide and pile up.

- The gears will be teleported back to you if they are too far (10m) after 10 seconds, it doesn't matter if it falls out of the world. Toggle off NotSoSilly (Default: O) before you are going to leave your newly placed gear immediately.

- The mod only enables collision. Some gears may have a different, usually larger collider than their visual representation, often using a simple box-shaped collider. Let's just say physics is not a major factor in this game, therefore physics accuracy is not prioritized.
