# NotSoSilly

Enable physics for gears placed so you can place your stuff around naturally, or pile up canned foods.

The goal is a somewhat acceptable alternative to SillyMod that is usable in survival.

First, enable the mod by pressing the Toggle Key (default is O), this is intended so players must intentionally use the mod.

Just like in Vanilla, right click to move gears, when it's placed, physics is enabled for 5 seconds.

If the item is too far away when the time's up, it will be teleported back to you. So no cheating and no need to worry about things fall into the ground (yes, that could happen).

You can also press the Retrieve Key (default: Backspace) to teleport items back to you. (Only possible in the 5 seconds)

#### It is a good idea to press Retrieve **immediately** when you see your gear falls into walls and grounds, because if somehow it falls on something in the walls/grounds and does not fall away, you could lose it for good.

(I started with [HAHAYOUDEAD's SillyMod](https://github.com/HAHAYOUDEAD/SillyMod) but eventually almost fully rewrite the mod)
